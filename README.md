Attic
===
A Scala library for building conf.d style configuration files.  Attic helps assemble a bunch of smaller configs contained in a directory to build larger and more complicated config files.  It optionally uses the Mustache templating language to structure the output.

We'll use an example from a Gitolite configuration to show where this might be useful.
