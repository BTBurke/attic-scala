Attic
===
A Scala library for building conf.d style configuration files.  This should be useful when you're building a master config file out of a large number of smaller snippets.  Attic helps assemble a bunch of smaller configs in a directory to build larger and more complicated config files.  It is capable of using the Mustache templating language to structure the output.

We'll use an example from a Gitolite configuration to show where this might be useful.
